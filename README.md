**About Me**

Hi, I'm Jason &ndash; a Software Engineer based in the New York City Metropolitan Area ðŸ—½. Iâ€™m passionate about solving problems and learning everyday. I'm an advocate for open-source projects! 

I have experience defining requirements, designing, implementing, testing, and delivering critical systems using variety of programming languages and technologies. When I'm not at work, you can find me geeking about home automation (shoutout to [@home-assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant)!), building [homelab](https://github.com/jsnallen/homelab), and exploring new places to eat!
